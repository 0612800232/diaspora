With Diaspora you can:

- Make cool stuff
- Share it across the web
- Own your own data


## Quick Start:

Here's how you can get a **[development](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)** environment up and running.  This is where any new pod runner should start, as well as people
looking to contribute to D*.  This script assumes you have [a basic Rails setup installed](http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails-3-1.html).

### Step 1: Download the script
```
  curl https://raw.github.com/diaspora/diaspora/master/script/install.sh | /bin/sh
```

### Step 2: Follow the instructions


### Step 3: Run the the development server
```
  rails s
```

then visit 'http://localhost:3000' in your browser.

### Step 4: Run tests
```
  rake
```
